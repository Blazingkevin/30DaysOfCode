# 30 DAYS OF CODE 


## DAY 1
Write a function that takes two strings, str1 and str2 . It checks if there are characters in str1  that can be selected and arranged to reproduce
str2 . 
#### Example:
 **scrable ("I game in rain","raining")** returns *True* , **scrable("football lovers", "lovely")** returns *False*.

## DAY 2
Write a function that takes a positive integer arguement. It returns the number of times each digit in the integer will be multiplied to get a single digit.
#### Example:
 **myFunction(26)** should return *2* (since 2 x 6 is 12, 1 x 2 is 2...it took *2* steps to get a single digit).

## DAY 3
Write a function that takes in two integer parameters. The first parameter is the required size(number of digits), while the second parameter is the number which would be formatted by adding leading zeros to meet the required size specified by the first parameter. The function returns the newly formatted number with the leading zeros added in form of a string. If the required number of digits is less than the number of digits the second parameter contains, return as is.
#### Example:
**myPackaging(5,22)===’00022’**
