# 30 DAYS OF CODE 


## DAY 1
Write a function that takes two strings, str1 and str2 . It checks if there are characters in str1  that can be selected and arranged to reproduce
str2 . E.g **scrable ("I game in rain","raining")** returns *True* , **scrable("football lovers", "lovely")** returns *False*.

## DAY 2
Write a function that takes a positive integer arguement. It returns the number of times each digit in the integer will be multiplied to get a single digit.
E.g **myFunction(26)** should return *2* (since 2 x 6 is 12, 1 x 2 is 2...it took *2* steps to get a single digit).
